# Deep-SLR : Deep Generalization of Structured Low-Rank Algorithms
Tensorflow implementation of hybrid Deep-SLR (H-DSLR) for undersampled multi-channel MRI reconstruction. It is a model-based deep learning approach to significantly
reduce the computational complexity of Structured low-rank (SLR) algorithms.
